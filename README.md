# good-place

A proposed Social Network intended to emphasise mental health and wellbeing. Whilst Facebook is focused on the News Feed, Good Place would be focused on a personalised virtual space. The News Feed would be customisable by post author and post topic, enabling the removal of upsetting or annoying topics as required. Unfortunately I didn't get too far with this before my attention was required elsewhere. I have no plans to work on this currently, but I may pick it up again at some point.
